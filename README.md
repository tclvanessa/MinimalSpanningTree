# Minimal Spanning Tree

This program implements Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of a graph. Suppose a new railway company would like to have train stations in all major US cities, and their transport network should "connect" all cities. To get some initial bounds on the cost of the routes, the company could find a minimum spanning tree of the graph where the nodes are cities and the edges are railroads. The cost of each edge would be equal to the cost of running trains between the two cities (when the company computes this cost, they should take many factors into account including distance, fees for using the existing railroads owned by other companies, or cost of building a new railroad, how popular this route would be etc.). In this project, the costs are proportional to the distance between cities.

This project has a graphical user interface (GUI) that will display the graph of cities on the map, and the minimal spanning tree.
